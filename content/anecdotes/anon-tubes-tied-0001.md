## The Scene
{{< back_to_top >}}

Two disabled humans discussing surgery and medical test preparation procedures that can cause great harm. They have been comparing notes and cross referencing useful tricks for improving pre and post procedure outcomes.

## An Anecdote
{{< back_to_top >}}

...

Like, when I had my tubes tied 10yra ago that "minor" surgery wrecked me.

In hindsight I would have said, I can't do no eating/drinking 12hrs before because my body doesn't hold water well. I went into the surgery already dehydrated, and afterwards couldn't stop barfing because morphine, and they wouldn't let me go until I peed, but of course I couldn't pee because I was dehydrated af.

So next time: I will fast but not stop fluida until 1hr before (or whatever is actually necessary for me not to risk puking and choking). I would tell them, no opiates so come up with a different pain plan, and I would say leave the IV running until I feel ok to eat/drink (they turn it of in recovery so they know you are taking in enough fluids).

## Reflection(s)
{{< back_to_top >}}

Anyway big meander to say, it might be worthwhile to talk about what you "really" need to do for this, and what else might be done to make it less grueling.

It would make the whole procedure less ruinous for your already stressed body, it would make you feel more in control and safe, and thus would hopefully dial down the triggery nature of another medical procedure.
