## You can negotiate with doctors
{{< back_to_top >}}

It may not be obvious but you *can* negotiate with your doctors about accommodating needs for what would normally be a trivial procedure, but isn't for us [the disabled].

Even with a pacing strategy, adaptations when you know you are going to encounter a major challenge to your system can be important and discussing options with a health care provider shoud address these challenges.

However, providers tend not to offer alternatives, adaptations or strategies unless prompted. It usually best to initiate a conversation with your provider instead of waiting for them to offer.

## When to negotiate?
{{< back_to_top >}}

Succinctly: every time.

Trips to the dentist, travel, big events, sick loved one, all can require negotiations with health care providers.

> This is gonna be hella hard on me, how do I mitigate that?

If you are asking yourself how to midigate the difficulties, you should ask your doctor to work with you to mitigate your difficulties.

It's also not just the name of the surgery or just "minor day surgery", which is the problem: "normal" people and doctors don't realize it isn't "minor" based on all the other shit I [we] have going on.

So this is really about speaking up for accommodations other don't even realize you need. And I didn't realize I needed until I was on the other side and went: well THAT could have gone better.
