## Overview
{{< back_to_top >}}

Finding and cleaning up cat urine can be difficult. The  below information is pretty much everything a person will need to know when it comes to dealing with cat urine.

{{< end_section >}}

## Finding a Culprit
{{< back_to_top >}}

When working with multiple animals and unsure of which is peeing: dye pills can be helpful. The dye will last 24-48 hours (ish) in a cat's system and their urine should be easy to see with UV lights.

Fluorescein dye pills can be prescribed by vets (usually 50 mg / cat) to help with identification. Alternatively, opthalmic strips can be impregnated with Fluorescein and fold six 9mg strips into a pill capsule.

> **Warning**
>
> Fluorescein dye pills can *stain* light fabrics and materials. *Test* in hidden spots *before* administering to an animal.

## UV Light
{{< back_to_top >}}

UV lights can be used to find urine spots. The below table has general info on how to find cat urine using UV light.

> **Warning**
> 
> Fresh (wet) cat urine may not fluoresce under UV light

Some things to keep in mind when using UV light:

| Characteristics | Values |
| - | - |
| Best UV range | 365-385 nm |
| Wavelengths to avoid | 390 nm, 400 nm |
| Light colour | Yellow or green |
| Room lighting | Dark room |
| Glowing colour of urine | Light yellow, light yellow-white/straw, neon green, faint light green |
| Shape of urine glow | Spot, puddle, splatter, drips, pool |
| Surfaces to check | Floor, walls, door frames, furniture, bedding, carpets (both sides), upholstery |
| Other substances that may glow | Cleaning products, wallpaper glue, bodily fluids, tonic water, drink spill, carpet cleaner, bleach |

## Cleaning
{{< back_to_top >}}

### General
{{< back_to_top >}}

This information applies to cleaning in general.

{{< end_section >}}

#### Removing Excess Cat Urine
{{< back_to_top >}}

- If the stain’s fresh, grab some paper towels or a clean rag and press down hard to soak up the liquid. Don’t rub, you’ll just spread the mess.
- Work from the outside in. That way, you keep the stain from creeping into clean fabric.
- If you’re dealing with dried stains, you’ll need to loosen things up. Mix equal parts cold water and white vinegar in a spray bottle and hit the area.
- Let it sit for a couple minutes, then blot again. You might need to treat each layer if the stain soaked through.

{{< end_section >}}

#### Blotting and Rinsing Techniques
{{< back_to_top >}}

- Always use cold water to rinse out cat urine. Hot water will just make the smell worse.
- Put the stained part under running cold water, letting it flow from the back side. That helps push the urine out instead of deeper in.
- Blot, don’t rub, with a clean cloth or paper towel. Swap out for fresh ones when they get wet.
- Keep rinsing and blotting until the water runs clear. It usually takes a few minutes.
- Give it a quick sniff while it’s still damp. If you pick up any odor, rinse again. You want it smelling neutral before moving on.

{{< end_section >}}

#### Household Items That Eliminate Cat Pee Smell
{{< back_to_top >}}

Three basics from your pantry or medicine cabinet can wipe out cat urine odor: baking soda, white vinegar, and hydrogen peroxide. Baking soda absorbs, vinegar neutralizes ammonia, and peroxide breaks down uric acid crystals.

How to use these items is included in the below sections.

{{< end_section >}}

### Fabrics
{{< back_to_top >}}

#### Cleaning Solution Method
{{< back_to_top >}}

- Blot the area to remove excess pee
- Apply the cleaning solution per the manufacturer's directions

{{< end_section >}}

#### Baking Soda Method
{{< back_to_top >}}

Baking soda’s great for soaking up moisture and neutralizing odors. It draws out the liquid and gets rid of the smell naturally.

##### For fresh stains
{{< back_to_top >}}

- Blot up as much urine as you can
- Sprinkle baking soda all over the wet spot
- Let it sit for 15–20 minutes
- Brush off the powder
- Wash in cold water

##### For dried stains
{{< back_to_top >}}

- Mix a cup of baking soda with a cup of warm water
- Soak the area for half an hour
- Gently scrub with an old toothbrush
- Rinse with cold water, then wash
- When the powder clumps up, it’s doing its job: pulling those odor compounds out.

{{< end_section >}}

#### White Vinegar Method
{{< back_to_top >}}

- Vinegar’s acid breaks down those lingering uric acid crystals.
- White vinegar’s acetic acid goes after the ammonia in cat pee. The reaction kills that sharp smell.
- Mix equal parts white vinegar and water. Pour it right onto the stain.
- Let it sit for 10–15 minutes. The vinegar smell fades as it dries, and the pee odor goes with it.
- Rinse with cold water, then wash as usual.

> **A few things to remember**
> 
> - Stick to clear vinegar, not the colored kind
> - Use 5% acidity vinegar
>   - More acidic will more easily damage fabrics
>   - Less acidic will *not* work
> - Test on a hidden spot first if you’re nervous
> - Don’t mix vinegar and bleach (seriously, just don’t)

{{< end_section >}}

#### Hydrogen Peroxide Method
{{< back_to_top >}}

- This method works best on fresh stains, but it can help with older ones too.
- Hydrogen peroxide oxidizes uric acid crystals, busting up the stuff that makes cat pee so persistent.
- Grab some 3% hydrogen peroxide and mix it half-and-half with water in a spray bottle.
- Spray it on the stain. If you see bubbles, that means it’s working.
- Let it sit for 5–10 minutes, then rinse with cold water. The bubbling helps lift stains and odors.

> **Warning**
> 
> - Test on a hidden spot first
> - It might lighten dark fabrics
> - Skip it on delicate stuff
> - Rinse well afterward

{{< end_section >}}

### Laundry
{{< back_to_top >}}

Cold water keeps cat urine from setting into fabric. You’ll want the right machine settings and cycles to break down odors. Air drying is usually better than heat drying; heat can lock in smells you thought you’d banished.

The below sections walk through the specifics.

{{< end_section >}}

#### Cold Water Pre-Soak
{{< back_to_top >}}

- Fill a sink or big bowl with cold water. For every two cups of water, toss in a cup of white vinegar.
- Submerge the soiled clothes, making sure they’re completely covered.
- Let them soak for at least 30 minutes. If the stain’s old, leave them for a couple hours.
- Vinegar goes after the uric acid; the main reason cat pee smells so strong and won’t budge with regular detergent.
- Give the fabric a gentle squeeze every 10 minutes or so. That helps the vinegar solution get deep into the fibers.
- When you’re done, lift the clothes out. Don’t wring them out too hard, or you might damage the fabric.

{{< end_section >}}

#### Washing Machine Settings
{{< back_to_top >}}

- Set your washer to use cold water. Hot water will just make the urine smell stick around forever.
- Add your usual laundry detergent; don’t overdo it, just use the amount on the label.
- Pour a cup of white vinegar into the fabric softener compartment. If your machine doesn’t have one, add it during the rinse.
- Add an enzyme booster (see the `Cleaning Kit & Supplies` section below) to help with pee removal. This is optional but strongly recommended.
- Pick the longest wash cycle your machine offers. More time means more odor-fighting action.
- Skip standard fabric softener. It can trap smells in the fibers.

{{< end_section >}}

#### Air Drying Versus Machine Drying
{{< back_to_top >}}

- Air drying is your best bet for clothes you’ve treated for cat urine. Dryer heat can seal in any leftover smells.
- Hang clothes outside if you can. Sunlight is a natural bacteria killer and helps break down lingering compounds.
- If you’re drying inside, pick a breezy, well-ventilated spot. Use a rack and keep it away from heaters.
- Give clothes a good sniff when they’re dry. Check all over; sometimes the smell hides.
- If you catch even a hint of pee, wash again. Don’t risk the dryer until you’re sure the odor’s gone.
- If you do use the dryer, go for the lowest heat, and only after you’re positive the smell is history.

{{< end_section >}}

#### Second Wash (Optional)
{{< back_to_top >}}

If the 'smell test' in the above still yields a pee smell, a second wash may be needed.

-  Add the same standard detergent and enzyme booster amounts as the first wash to the washing machine, add two cups of white vinegar straight into the drum and then run another wash cycle.
- If your fabric can handle it, use hot water. The heat can help break down any uric acid crystals that survived round one.
- Still skip standard fabric softener. It’s just going to trap whatever’s left in the fibers.
- For a little extra oomph, throw in a cup of baking soda along with the vinegar. The fizz helps lift odors out.
- After this wash, check the clothes while they’re still damp. Give them a sniff test. If you still smell anything, wash again before you even think about drying.

{{< end_section >}}

#### Sunlight Exposure
{{< back_to_top >}}

- Hang your clothes outside in direct sun after washing. UV rays are great at killing odor-causing bacteria that your washer might miss.
- Fresh air helps carry away any lingering smells. Even a gentle breeze does wonders.
- Leave them out for at least 4–6 hours, and flip them inside out halfway through so both sides get sun.

{{< end_section >}}

### Bedding
{{< back_to_top >}}

Note: The `Fabrics` section has additional information to keep in mind. 

'Bedding' is a pretty open-ended and can include a number of components, each of which need to be cleaned a different way. The below lays out how to clean different bedding components.

- Bedding such as sheets, blankets and pillows should be cleaned the same as laundry
- Mattresses should be cleaned the same as upholstery and carpet
- Bed frames and other bedding components should be cleaned the same as walls and wood

{{< end_section >}}

### Upholstery & Carpet
{{< back_to_top >}}

Note: The `Fabrics` section has additional information to keep in mind.

The standard methods in the `Fabrics` section should work well with upholstery and carpet, particularly the `Cleaning Solution Method`. However, if the pee is stubborn and won't come out, a deep cleaner may be necessary to remove the pee.

See the below `Cleaning Kit & Supplies` section for deep cleaner hardware options that work well with upholstery. Follow the manufacturer instructions for cleaning when using a deep cleaner.

{{< end_section >}}

### Walls / Wood
{{< back_to_top >}}

The best way to clean walls and wood is to use a cleaning solution that contains enzymes, such as `Resolve Urine Destroyer`.

If the cat pee had a chance to soak into paint, drywall, wood, etc; it may not come out of the surface fully. Cat pee has a habit of seeping into wood, paint and drywall to the point it becomes impossible to get out.

If this happens, clean the best you can and let some of the cleaning solution soak on the surface until dry. This will help neutralize as much of the pee as possible and should prevent cats from peeing on the spot again.

> **Note**
> 
> The stained area will always fluoresce under UV light so it can be difficult to know if a cat peed in the spot again. Smelling the surface is probably the best way to tell if a cat peed on a stained area after it has been cleaned.
