## How to get cat pee out of clothes
{{< back_to_top >}}

To get cat pee out of clothes you can wash them with the following washer settings. Dry them per your usual methods.

- Gentle or hand wash cycle
- Use standard detergent per your norms
- Add 1/2 or 3/4 cup white vinegar (the common stuff that's 5% strength) to the 'fabric softener' hopper
  - Use the higher amount if there are a lot of affected clothes or they have dried with cat pee on them
- Use COLD water for both the wash and rinse cycles
  - If you use warm or hot water, the cat pee smell will get 'set' into your clothes and never come out
- Start the washer and continue per your norms
