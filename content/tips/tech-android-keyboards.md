## Good Android Keyboards, A List
{{< back_to_top >}}

-   [Unexpected Keyboard](https://github.com/Julow/Unexpected-Keyboard)
    -   full blown qwerty keeb implementation
    -   if you use termux/juicessh/connectbot/other terms you want this keeb
    -   has a lot of good features and tunables
    -   can have custom layouts (there are docs and a web based layout editor)
    -   kemonine implemented a messagease layout for unexpected [here](https://git.kemonine.info/kemonine/keyboard/src/branch/main/unexpected_keyboard)
    -   if you use this keeb and are considering thumb key or flickboard, consider using kemo's messagease layout for this keeb instead
-   [HeliBoard](https://github.com/Helium314/HeliBoard)
    -   basically a std android keep with the usual features
    -   qwerty / bog std for what youd expect these days
-   [Florisboard](https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard)
    -   boring qwerty with spell check/auto-correct/etc 'under development'
    -   qwerty / ultra boring
    -   what kemonine uses for a 'standard / normie using their phone keeb'
-   [Thumb Key](https://github.com/dessalines/thumb-key)
    -   a novel one handed layout with speed in mind
    -   one handed and fast once you learn the layout
    -   is a spiritual successor to messagease
    -   includes messagease layouts (use the messagease ones, not thumb-key ones)
    -   has good blend of features but not 'all' ive seen asked for
    -   this or flickboard will be a win for most
-   [Flickboard](https://github.com/nightkr/flickboard)
    -   novel one handed layout with speed in mind
    -   uses std messagease layouts
    -   was created because messagease moved to a subscription model to use
    -   has good blend of features but not 'all' ive seen asked for
    -   this or thumb-key will be a win for most
-   [8VIM](https://github.com/8VIM/8VIM)
    -   if youre into swiping to type, this is the keeb for you
    -   has a novel approach thats faster than the qwerty swiping keebs
    -   highly regarded as 'good' and definitely worth investigating if swiping is your thing
-   [Grafitti](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.access_company.graffiti_pro)
    -   literal palm grafitti on android
    -   works with s pen and adonit styluses and others
    -   install on any device where pen may be used
