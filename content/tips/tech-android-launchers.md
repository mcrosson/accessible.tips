## What?
{{< back_to_top >}}

This page outlines a number of different launchers that can make working with an Android device less frustrating. It's a simple list and it's assumed you can sort which launcher you prefer based trying the options that look most compelling (or all of them).

## Good Android Launchers, A List
{{< back_to_top >}}

-   [olauncher](https://github.com/tanujnotes/Olauncher) / [pro launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.prolauncher) by digital minimalism
    -   for focused devices (boox book devices / fiio music devices / etc)
    -   simple, straightforward and gets out of your way
    -   has some basic amenities but is very clearly 'a textual list of apps' above all else
-   [niagara launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bitpit.launcher)
    -   great text launcher
    -   if you're into text lists, this is a good one to review
    -   can do widgets and more on 'main page'
    -   very good 'list style'
    -   youll want pro to get at all the fancier tunables
    -   if you're into olauncher or text launchers, this is worth looking at closer
-   [smart launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ginlemon.flowerfree)
    -   highly tunable
    -   mash up of Nova and microsoft launchers
    -   probably a better starting point than Nova these days
    -   no way to have separate layouts for phone and tablet modes
-   [square home](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details/Square_Home?id=com.ss.squarehome2&hl=en_US)
    -   think windows phone launcher and windows 8 start menu tile/dash board setups
    -   literally: this _is_ a proper hot take on the windows 8 and windows phone launcher stuff
-   [aio launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.execbit.aiolauncher)
    -   minimal launcher with lots of 'bells and whistles'
    -   feels like a big text dashboard
-   [nova launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher)
    -   great, been around forever custom launcher on the whole
    -   no way to have separate layouts for phone and tablet modes -- this is a deal breaker
    -   seeing implications the devs have no interest in foldable phone support / dual screen support
    -   may be on life support post-purchase from the original dev/team
    -   smart launcher is probably the better choice as of the writing of this blog post
