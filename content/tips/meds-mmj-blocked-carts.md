To clear the blockage

1. Disconnect the cart
1. Push a metal tooth pick into the cart blockage. You should feel a push back.
    - Note: Do *not* push all the way through the blockage
1. Wiggle the tooth pick around lightly
1. Pull the toothpick out in a quick motion
1. Repeat above until you can draw on the disconnected cart freely
1. Re-attach cart and enjoy
1. Use a towel and isopropyl alcohol at a greater than or equal to 80% concentration to clean the tooth pick
