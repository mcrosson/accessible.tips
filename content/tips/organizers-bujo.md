## Considerations
{{< back_to_top >}}

When it comes to [Bullet Journals](https://bulletjournal.com/) the biggest and only consideration is: "does it work for you?".

There are many bullet journal examples readily available for review and inspiration. The hard part is figuring out which elements work best for you, the individual.

## Learning Curve
{{< back_to_top >}}

Due to the open ended nature of analog organizers there can be a steep learning curve. Bullet Journal doesn't have a super steep learning curve but the sheer volume of different approaches can be a big problem for getting under way.

It may be wise to start with a pre-made, mass produced Bullet Journal instead of trying to forge your own path from the start.
