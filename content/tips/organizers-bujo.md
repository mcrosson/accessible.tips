## Considerations
{{< back_to_top >}}

When it comes to [Bullet Journals](https://bulletjournal.com/) the biggest and only consideration is: "does it work for you?".

There are many bullet journal examples readily available for review and inspiration. The hard part is figuring out which elements work best for you, the individual.

## Does It Work?
{{< back_to_top>}}

BuJo works for a great many people but *not* everybody. If you find yourself struggling to engage with paper or if you find aspects of your setup tedious in a bad way, it may be time to consider making changes.

BuJo isn't a rigid system and it's loose. This can be a very good and very bad thing. It's a "Doubly edged sword" type of situation. Some people do really well with "loose" and others do not.

Definitely consider how you use a BuJo and if it feels like it's too much effort or even off putting or if you can't seem to find a way to adapt it to your needs, you will definitely want to consider alternatives.

Please note: it can take well over a week to find frustration points with a BuJo, give it a good try before giving up.

## Learning Curve
{{< back_to_top >}}

Due to the open ended nature of analog organizers there can be a learning curve. Bullet Journal doesn't have a steep learning curve but the sheer volume of different approaches can be a big problem for getting under way.

It may be wise to start with a pre-made, mass produced Bullet Journal instead of trying to forge your own path from the start.

If you want to jump right in, KemoNine would advise looking for examples online, picking a few to try and starting as soon as you have your supplies.

## Where To Start?
{{< back_to_top >}}

Starting with the main [website](https://bulletjournal.com/) is a good choice. From there: internet searches should turn up some good ideas on how to build a BuJo that may work for you.

There are a lot of how to guides, videos and more on bullet journaling and applying it to varied arts, crafts, sciences and more. It's all about finding a notebook flow that works for the way you think.
