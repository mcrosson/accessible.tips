## The Only Consideration
{{< back_to_top >}}

Before we get too far into opinion land, I'd like to point out the only considerations I consider important.

They are:

-   What works for your hands?
-   Is it comfortable?
-   Does it cause health issues or pain? (It should **not**)
-   It doesn't get in the way of you enjoying a game
-   Paddles should be a consideration as a requirement. They allow your thumbs to remain on look/move and still retain the ability to jump/reload/etc while also moving and looking around
-   Ensure there are at least two buttons/paddles on the controller grips OR it has 3 total buttons per 'shoulder': standard shoulder button, trigger, additional button that can be bound to any other button

If the above considerations are met, I think it's a perfectly valid and acceptable controller for use.

This post is about how I got controllers to "get out of my way" and be comfortable for regular use. Nothing more.

## Controller Clips
{{< back_to_top >}}

While reviewing the below I'd like to note the 8bitdo controller clip works very well with a number of Xbox styled controllers. It works so well, I use it with my Microsoft Elite Series 2 as well as my Scuff Instinct. I also have a short usb-c cable I use to connect the controller to the phone.

It can be a really good option for phones that won't work with some of the nicer, more phone focused controllers.

{{< back_to_top >}}

### Some Considerations
{{< back_to_top >}}

- Very good options available
- Lets you use a lot of 'good' controllers freely
- Weight/portability can be an issue
- Center of gravity can be a problem depending on the controller

## JoyCon Clips
{{< back_to_top >}}

If you are considering JoyCons for non-switch gaming (imo: you should), I'd like to call attention to the Joyclamp on Tindie from an open hardware person. The clamp setup will allow you to attach JoyCons to phones **and** tablets to facilitate more generic controller support on mobile.

I've included a link in the `Links` section to the product page.

{{< back_to_top >}}

### Some Considerations
{{< back_to_top >}}

- Very helpful for oddly sized devices
- Vertical orientation support can sometimes be problematic (See the `Adapters & Compatibility` section for additional detail)
- Rumble can get 'stuck' until you perform another action that triggers rumble allowing the state to re-set
- Connecting JoyCons via bluetooth can be fiddly and take multiple attempts to get them into 'vertical mode' when used on non-switch platforms

{{< end_section >}}

## Adapters & Compatibility
{{< back_to_top >}}

Before getting to the actual controllers, I'd like to point out some compatibility problems I've seen over time.

- JoyCons default to **horizontal** orientation when used over bluetooth and it can require a USB adapter to force them into **vertical** orientation
- JoyCons can be fiddly upon initial connection but once they are in the right 'mode', without lag, they work very well. This is a well known quirk and pain point with JoyCons
- Playstation controllers I've always struggled to get working without an adapter, please consider using an adapter with Playstation controllers

To work around the JoyCon compatibility issues above, I bought a MayFlash Magic-S Pro 2 adapter that works with USB type-a as well as usb-c adapters and OTG adapters. This is particularly useful with JoyCons and tablets or folding phones. The MayFlash makes bluetooth JoyCons work in vertical orientation more reliably and I've found them to save a lot of hassles related to JoyCons on non-switch platforms.

I've included a link to the MayFlash website in the `Links` section.

Some additional notes on the MayFlash when used with JoyCons:

- If there is lag to the controls: re-connect the JoyCons
- If a JoyCon gets 'stuck' in horizontal mode: re-connect the JoyCons
- Connecting the right then left JoyCon tends to be more reliable for connections
- The `XInput` mode of the MayFlash works reliably on Android and shows the adapter as a generic Xbox 360 controller

## Controllers
{{< back_to_top >}}

### Microsoft Elite Series 2
{{< back_to_top >}}

- Hard to beat for comfort
- I especially like the paddle layout and where the rear paddles are placed
- The paddles do **not** seem to work over Bluetooth
- I do **not** recommend this controller if you need Bluetooth connection support
- The tuning app is second to none, it's worth the extra cost to me

{{< back_to_top >}}

### Scuff Instinct
{{< back_to_top >}}

- Next best controller to the Microsoft Elite Series 2
- The paddles are more horizontally laid out and its difficult to push both paddles on the same side concurrently
- The 'rear' paddle is a 'push' motion which confuses my mind slightly
- It **works** with paddles over Bluetooth
- The profiles for button mappings to the paddles works
- The tuning is far less than the Microsoft Elite Series 2 but more than enough for general gaming

{{< back_to_top >}}

### Razer Kishi v1 and v2
{{< back_to_top >}}

- v1 not worth it due to lack of paddles/grip buttons and it's End Of Life, **avoid** this version
- v2 is very nice if your phone can be used with it
- The app is required for extra button mapping the two extra shoulder buttons
- Light and portable
- No first party case but third party cases work well

{{< back_to_top >}}

### Gamsir X2 Pro
{{< back_to_top >}}

- Next best mobile controller to the Kishi v2
- Has 2 paddles
- Will fit more usb-c phones than the Kishi
- Slightly odd paddle placement
- The app is required for paddle mapping
- Came with a case that can also hold a phone without modifications

{{< back_to_top >}}

### BinBok DOYOKY Classic JoyCons
{{< back_to_top >}}

- Best overall JoyCons
- Need adapter or OS support for vertical mode (known issue with **all** JoyCons)
- Works with Bluetooth quite well on non-switch platforms
- Has rumble support

{{< back_to_top >}}

### Hori Split Pad (Compact & Pro)
{{< back_to_top >}}

- Best wired JoyCons
- The `Attachment` versions come with the JoyCons **and** USB adapter
- Lack bluetooth, only USB and native switch support
- Lack rumble support

{{< back_to_top >}}

### 8bitdo NES Controller
{{< back_to_top >}}

- Works great with bluetooth
- If you need an original style NES controller, this is the one to buy in my opinion

{{< back_to_top >}}

### PowerA MOGA XP-7
{{< back_to_top >}}

- Has 2 paddles, one on each grip
- Worth considering for mobile and or bluetooth needs if the Kishi v2 isn't an option in my opinion
- Can hold most phones in cases in my light testing
- Big and semi-heavy, worthy of xbox controller licensing
- It **works** with paddles over bluetooth
- Way to large and unwieldy with my phone in my hands
- The charging is via Qi (wireless) only
