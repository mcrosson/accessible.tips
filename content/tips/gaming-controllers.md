## The Only Consideration
{{< back_to_top >}}

Before we get too far, I'd like to point out the only considerations I consider important.

They are:

- What works for your hands?
- Is it comfortable?
- Does it cause health issues or pain? (It should **not**)
- It doesn't get in the way of you enjoying a game
- Paddles should be a consideration as a requirement. They allow your thumbs to remain on look/move and still retain the ability to jump/reload/etc while also moving and looking around
- Ensure there are at least two buttons/paddles on the controller grips OR it has 3 total buttons per 'shoulder': standard shoulder button, trigger, additional button that can be bound to any other button

If the above considerations are met, I think it's a perfectly valid and acceptable controller for use.

This page is about how I got controllers to "get out of my way" and be comfortable for regular use. Nothing more.

## Controller Clips
{{< back_to_top >}}

While reviewing the below I'd like to note the 8bitdo controller clip works very well with a number of Xbox styled controllers. It works so well, I use it with my Microsoft Elite Series 2 as well as my Scuff Instinct. I also have a short usb-c cable I use to connect the controller to the phone.

It can be a really good option for phones that won't work with some of the nicer, more phone focused controllers.

### Some Considerations
{{< back_to_top >}}

- Very good options available
- Lets you use a lot of 'good' controllers freely
- Weight/portability can be an issue
- Center of gravity can be a problem depending on the controller

## Controllers
{{< back_to_top >}}

### Microsoft Elite Series 2
{{< back_to_top >}}

- Hard to beat for comfort
- I especially like the paddle layout and where the rear paddles are placed
- The paddles do **not** seem to work over Bluetooth
- I do **not** recommend this controller if you need Bluetooth connection support
- The tuning app is second to none, it's worth the extra cost to me

{{< back_to_top >}}

### Scuff Instinct
{{< back_to_top >}}

- Next best controller to the Microsoft Elite Series 2
- The paddles are more horizontally laid out and its difficult to push both paddles on the same side concurrently
- The 'rear' paddle is a 'push' motion which confuses my mind slightly
- It **works** with paddles over Bluetooth
- The profiles for button mappings to the paddles works
- The tuning is far less than the Microsoft Elite Series 2 but more than enough for general gaming

### Razer Kishi v1 and v2
{{< back_to_top >}}

- v1 not worth it due to lack of paddles/grip buttons and it's End Of Life, **avoid** this version
- v2 is very nice if your phone can be used with it
- The app is required for extra button mapping the two extra shoulder buttons
- Light and portable
- No first party case but third party cases work well

### 8bitdo NES Controller
{{< back_to_top >}}

- Works great with bluetooth
- If you need an original style NES controller, this is the one to buy in my opinion

{{< back_to_top >}}

### PowerA MOGA XP-7
{{< back_to_top >}}

- Has 2 paddles, one on each grip
- Worth considering for mobile and or bluetooth needs if the Kishi v2 isn't an option in my opinion
- Can hold most phones in cases in my light testing
- Big and semi-heavy, worthy of xbox controller licensing
- It **works** with paddles over bluetooth
- Way to large and unwieldy with my phone in my hands
- The charging is via Qi (wireless) only
