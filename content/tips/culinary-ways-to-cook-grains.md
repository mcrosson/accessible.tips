## The Techniques
{{< back_to_top >}}

There are a number of common ways to cook grains

- Cooking them with extra water so they are more like porridge
- Cooking them really runny like cream of wheat (maybe with coconut milk or something if you don't have other milks in house)
- Adding sugar and coconut milk (and eggs) a la rice pudding
- Making congee - a savory rice porridge with chicken (or other) stock. A tonne of variations of flavours from here, once you start thinking savory
- And also salads, like tabouli salad but swapping in other grains, quinoa is really nice I know for sure, haven't tried amaranth
