   - Set on high heat
      - Run tests for both covered and uncovered
   - Time how long to boil
- Check boiling things at 1/2, 2/3 and 3/4 time marks
- Focus on "simmer" for `n` minutes starches
   - Once simmering, pretty hands off
   - "ancient" and "whole" grains are all 15 - 45 minute simmer times
- Yogurt that's "fancy" but cheap and not heavy on processed ingredients
   - Plain, unsweetened yogurt (2 big spoon fulls)
   - Honey, agave nectar, or maple syrup (1 tablespoon ish)
   - Preserves or jam (1 tablespoon ish)
   - Fruit if desired

- Wild rice + long grain rice blends take 40+ minutes to simmer hands off
   - Good low effort nutrition
   - Bullion, broth, and spices can add significant flavor and savoriness
- You can cook rice and chicken together in a rice cooker

   - Saute onion then add rice + spinach + water for additional flavor
   - Add lemon juice and olive oil when serving for a savory but bright meal

   - Good filler for adding carbs and texture
   - Is a good addition to tuna salad and similar dishes
- Toasting grains / nuts / etc

   - Add rice
   - Stir/mix until rice turns translucent
   - Add water
   - Bring to boil uncovered
   - Reduce to simmer
   - Cover
   - Wait recommended amount of cook time (usually 20 or 40 minutes and 5 minute rest)
- Sunflower oil...
   - Has a mild flavor that goes well with sauteed vegetables, can be better for cooking than canola or olive oil
   - Is considered a healthy oil
   - Works as a butter substitute for popcorn
- Olive oil works as a dressing in many context. Can be a good addition for dry foods.
- Vinegar comes in many varieties, each having its own flavor profile. This can be a good dressing option.
- Honey + Sumac makes a sweet yet savory dip for proteins like chicken or pork
- Simple baked protein with seasoning

   - Add honey, agave nectar or maple syrup to make it properly sweet
   - Add fruit, jam, preserves or similar for flavor
- Steel cut oats can be a good "hands off" base

   - Mustard for after bite
   - You do *not* need much as it's a thin sauce that is absorbed into a stir fry, rice and other ingredients
   - This works as a salad dressing too
- Granola recipes tend to be oats, honey and fruit mixed then baked on a parchment lined sheet
   - This may be a good, low brain option
   - The recipes ask you to mix the ingredients which can get "heavy" enough to be an issue for some
- Jerky
   - Is surprisingly low thought
   - Can be made with ground meat

   - Takes 4 - 12 hours untouched
- Dehydration, canning and fermentation can be helpful for some food prep and storage though the up front learning curves may be high
- You can add spices directly to the water grains simmer in. If toasting, add spices when toasting for added flavor
- You do *not* have to use "official" water ratios for grains like rice, quinoa, barley and others that hold shape like pasta

   - Drain like pasta when cooked to desired tenderness
   - This does *not* apply to
      - Amaranth

- Use an electric kettle to heat water ahead of need
   - Best for gas stoves that take a long time to boil water

- Peeling
   - Some folks prefer peelers
   - Some folks prefer paring knives
   - Both are valid and use different motions -- one may be more valid than the other depending on your individual biology
- Rice cookers and pressure cookers *are* valid options for cooking meat
- Boiling meat is valid
- Look for "chicken and rice one pot" online for easy chicken and rice meals. This also works for other proteins.
- Slow cooker recipes can usually be simplified
   - Can sometimes be turned into "one pot" styled meals
- Instant Pot
   - Can saute, boil, steam and pressure cook

   - Can be frozen
   - Reheat well
- Brown rice is...
   - Far more nutritious than brown rice

- Fresh baked bread freezes safely
- Fruit juices freeze reasonably well
   - Use ice cube trays for portion control

   - Is a *separate* plant species from rice
   - Is more nutritious than brown rice
   - Is very filling
   - Has a 3:1 water ratio (ish)
- Ethnic foods skew "one pot" and can be surprisingly straight forward to cook
- Most one pot meals and carbs can be judged for "doneness" by smell, using more than a timer in cooking is very valid
- Broiled vegetables
   - Zucchini, squash, potato, asparagus, carrot, etc
   - Cut into larger / thick slices or chunks
   - Toss in olive oil and spices
   - Under broiler or bake until tender
   - This cooks quickly, rarely more than 5 minutes in a broiler and 10 minutes at 350 Fahrenheit

   - You can do this at home
   - Coat in olive oil + Dust with spices
   - Bake / broil until safe to eat at desired "doneness"
- Ghee (if obtainable) is a great fat to use for toasting rice, it adds a richness that you can't get from other fats

- Any ground cooking can be a danger to yourself, children, pets, etc
   - Related to cooking on the ground sitting being valid
- Adding variety, not complexity
   - Meal prep only base ingredients, not full meals (if able)
   - Keep things unseasoned, add when reheating
- Low Brain Tricks
   - Stick to 5 - 6 "staple recipes" that can be made on auto pilot and provide foundational nutrition
   - Find 12 staples that can be varied over time and swap one staple for another over time so food doesn't feel highly rigid or templated
- Recipe development
   - Find 6 existing recipes that are "close"
   - Look for the minimum of common ingredients

   - Make the minimum version
   - Add spices from recipes to fill flavor profile to your preferences
