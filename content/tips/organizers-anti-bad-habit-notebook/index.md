## The Notebook
{{< back_to_top >}}

Breaking bad habits are very difficult and a lack of a good 'visual cue' for how often I succumb and how bad/good I'm doing.

I stumbled across Habit Trackers for Bullet Journals (BuJo) and after some thought I realized you could make an Anti Bad Habit BuJo spread.

After talking with many people, it seems having a visual cue for how often you're doing something helps. Same goes for goofy additions (see the red in the below image) that reinforce the positive.
