## What?
{{< back_to_top >}}

This page outlines how to split your computer audio output so a game or aplication's audio is sent to your speaker and the voice audio is sent to a headset.

This can be helpful for those with speech processing needs. It allows you to isolate voice to a headset or similar which lets the voice audio come through more strongly than any other audio.

1. Open main settings application
