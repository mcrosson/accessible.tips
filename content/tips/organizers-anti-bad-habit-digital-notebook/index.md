## Analog Version

This post is about the digital anti bad habit notebook. For an analog version implemented as a pocket notebook, see [this tip]({{< ref "tips/organizers-anti-bad-habit-notebook" >}}).

## The Post

Not going to lie : I have a few bad habits and have used my analog anti bad habit notebook to break some in teh past.

Sadly, I can no longer reliably use analog methods for my notes and similar. Due to this I went ahead and re-implemented the anti bad habit analog notebook as an Obsidian vault. So far it's proven very helpful for tracking a bad habit I want to break and should work well for pretty much any "bad habit" one may want to break.

I've published a template Obsidian vault [here](https://git.kemonine.info/kemonine/digital-anti-bad-habit-notebook) for those that may desire a digital form of the anti bad habit notebook. Just note: there is a small amount of setup but once you've got everything setup, it Just Works.
