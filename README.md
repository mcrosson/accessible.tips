## A collection of accessibility tips, tricks and life hacks

Welcome to the accessible.tips knowledge base code repository.

The intent of this repo and the deployed website is to be a [zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) knowledge base of highly cross referenced, highly focused tips, tricks and life hacks. Most of the tips are intentionally kept short to keep from overwhelming our users with information on a single page. We have included links to related material and additional details for each tip so you can easily discover additional detail and do a deep dive into a topic.
